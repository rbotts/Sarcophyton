The following code was used to analyze a collection of gas chromatography data on cryptic species of coral.  Tools used in the analysis are PCA and LDA.  Additionally PCoA and PLS-DA were run on the data.

All analysis is executable via the CoralProjUpdatedAnalysis.RMD.  Essential data is included in AllTCoralDat.csv.  

A portion of this project was analyzed in Metaboanalyst.  The RHistory and output has also been included here for record keeping.
